; ==== TEST CASE FOR 6 TRILLION ===============================================================================================

Welcome to the harmonic series by Sina Amini 

This program will compute a partial sum of the harmonic series

These results were obtained on a Lenovo Y500 labtop with Core-i7 quad core processor at 2.4GHz 

Please enter a positive integer for the number of terms to include in the harmonic sum: 6000000000000
The harmonic sum H(6000000000000) is being computed.
Please be patient . . . .
+The sum is now computed.
The clock time before the calculations began was  198313690678696 
The clock time after completion of calculations was 306003681200304 
The harmonic computation required 107689990521608 clock cycles (tics) which is 44870.8293840033 seconds on this machine.
The harmonic sum of 6000000000000 terms is 29.9999791226, which is 0x403dfffea1bffbf3.
This assembly program will now return to the caller

The driver received these numbers: 6000000000000 and 29.9999791226
The driver will now return a 0 to the operating system.
