;Preconditions
mov        rax, 0x000000000000000d                          ;Place 13 in rax.  This number is provided in the Intel manual
mov        rcx, 0                                           ;0 is parameter that requests the subfunction that creates the bitmap

;Call the function
cpuid                                                       ;cpuid is an essential function that returns information about the cpu

;Postconditions (There are 2 of these):

;1.  edx:eax is a bit map of state components managed by xsave.  At the time this was written (year 2014) there were exactly 3 state components.  Therefore, bits numbered
;    2, 1, and 0 are important for current cpu technology.
;2.  ecx holds the number of bytes required to store all the data of enabled state components. [Post condition 2 is not used in this program.]
;This program assumes that under current technology (year 2014) there are at most three state components having a maximum combined data storage requirement of 832 bytes.
;Therefore, the value in ecx will be less than or equal to 832.

;Precaution: As an insurance against a future time when there will be more than 3 state components in a processor of the X86 family the state component bitmap is masked to
;allow only 3 state components maximum.

xor        rdx, rdx                                         ;A register xored with itself becomes zero

;========== Save all the data of all the enabled state components; GPRs are excluded ======================================================================================

;The instruction xsave will save those state components with one bits in the bitmap.  At this point edx:eax continues to hold the state component bitmap.

;Precondition: edx:eax holds the state component bit map.  This condition has been met.

;Since the start of this program two critical GPRs have changed values, namely: rcx and rdx.  These are critical because they are among the six registers used to pass 
;non-float data to subprograms like this one.  To be absolutely sure that the six data passing registers have their passed-in values all six will have original values 
;restored to them although only two were at risk of losing their passed-in values.
